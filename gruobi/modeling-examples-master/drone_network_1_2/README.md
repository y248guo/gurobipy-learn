## Drone-Network Design Queueing Model

The notebook files come from the [Gurobi Days Digital 2022](https://www.gurobi.com/gurobi-days-digital-event-2022/) presentation: *Maximizing Survival to Time-Sensitive Medical Events: Drone-Network Design Queueing MINLP Model*. Use the link and register to view the presentation for more context around the model and its motivation.

If you have a full Gurobi license you can download the notebook and input data csv files, otherwise to run the notebook in Colab on a limited license, [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/drone_network_1_2/drone_network_gcl.ipynb).

The model and data come from the following studies:

- Lejeune M.A., Margot F. 2022. Drone-Network Design for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests. Working Paper, submitted.
- Custodio.J., Lejeune M.A. 2022. Spatiotemporal Data Set of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests. INFORMS Journal on Computing 34 (1), 4-10.
