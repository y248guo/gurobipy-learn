# Decentralization Planning



This model is an example of a facility location problem. Given a set of departments of a company, and potential cities 
where these departments can be located, we want to determine the "best" location of each department in order to maximize 
gross margins. This problem is formulated as a quadratic assignment problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with 
the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 10 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 265 and 317-319.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that 
you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or 
constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
