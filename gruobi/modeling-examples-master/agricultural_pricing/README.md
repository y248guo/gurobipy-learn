# Agricultural Pricing



This problem is an example of an agricultural pricing problem, where we want to determine the prices and demand for the 
dairy products of a country in order to maximize total revenue derived from the sales of those products. 
This problem is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi 
Optimizer.

This model is example 21 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 276-278 and 333-335.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with the 
Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.
