<img src="spotify_image_howtogeek.jpeg" alt="Markdown Monster icon"/>

This example creates a music recommendation using mathematical optimization. The solution comprises of a set of artists that likable and diverse, and caters to a user of a music streaming platform. Users' preferences are learned using collaborative filtering  (via matrix factorization) and the artist selection is optimized using an Integer Program. This example illustrates how a prediction model combines with a prescriptive model to create a recommendation that is fine-tuned to a user's likes.
