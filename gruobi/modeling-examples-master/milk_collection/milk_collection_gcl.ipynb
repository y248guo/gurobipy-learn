    "In this example, you’ll discover how mathematical optimization can be leveraged to solve a capacitated vehicle routing problem: the Milk Collection Problem. With only one tanker truck with limited capacity, you will need to determine the best possible route for the tanker to take to collect milk every day from a set of farms. It’s a complicated problem to solve, but mathematical optimization will help show you the way!\n",

The other nine farms need a collection every day. The positions of the farms in relation to the depot (numbered 1) are given in the following table together with their collection requirements.\n",
