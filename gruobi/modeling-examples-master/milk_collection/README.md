# Milk Collection Problem

The Milk Collection Problem is an example of a capacitated vehicle routing problem. In this problem, one tanker 
lorry with limited capacity, collects milk from a set of farms, and the goal is to identify the optimal route 
for the tanker. This problem is formulated as a binary optimization problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved 
with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 23 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams 
on pages 278-281 and 336-337.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API 
and you have  advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function 
and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
