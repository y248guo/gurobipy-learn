# Economic Planning

This model is an example of an economic planning problem that a country may face. This problem is an input–output model 
representing the interrelationships between the different sectors of a country’s economy. In such problems, the goal 
is to determine different possible growth patterns for the economy. The input-output model is formulated as a linear 
programming problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 9 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 263-264 and 316-317.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with the 
Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.
