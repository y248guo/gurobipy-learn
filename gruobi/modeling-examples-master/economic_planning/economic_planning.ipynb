    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we assume that we have an economy with three types of industries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coal\n",
    "* Steel\n",
    "* Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the outputs from these industries are needed as inputs to others. For example, coal is needed to fire the blast furnaces that produce steel, steel is needed in the machinery for extracting coal, etc. We measure all units of production in monetary terms.  That is, each dollar of production by one of the industries requires inputs (in dollars) from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. The required inputs as well as the labor requirements (also measured in dollars) are shown in the following table. \n",
    "\n",
    "| input (t) / <br /> output (t+1) | Coal | Steel | Transport |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| Coal | 0.1 | 0.5 | 0.4 | \n",
    "| Steel | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.2 |\n",
    "| Transport | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.2 |\n",
    "| Labor | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.2 | \n",
    "|**Total**  | **1** | **1** | **1**|\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t +1 requires an input in year t.  For example, to produce one-dollar worth of coal requires 0.1 dollars of coal (to provide the necessary power), 0.1 dollars of steel (the steel ‘used up’ in the ‘wear and tear’ on the machinery) and 0.2 dollars of transport (for moving the coal from the mine). In addition, 0.6 dollars of manpower is required. Similarly, the other columns of the table give the inputs required (in dollars) for each dollar of steel and each dollar of transport (trucks, cars, trains, etc.). Notice that the value of each unit of output is exactly matched by the sum of the values of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years. The inputs required to give unit increases (capacity in dollars’ worth of extra production) in productive capacity are given in the following table. Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t +2.\n",
    "\n",
    "| input (t) / <br /> output (t+2) | Coal | Steel | Transport |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| Coal | 0.1 | 0.7 | 0.9 | \n",
    "| Steel | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.2 |\n",
    "| Transport | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.2 |\n",
    "| Labor | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.1 | \n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. At present (the beginning of year 1), the stocks and productive capacities (per year) are given in the following table (in millions of dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Present | Stocks | Productive Capacity |\n",

    "| Steel | 80 | 350 | \n",
    "| Transport | 100 | 280 |  \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to maximize the total manpower utilization i.e. employment, over the planning horizon while meeting an exogenous consumption requirement in every year:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 60 million dollars of coal. \n",
    "* 60 million dollars of steel.\n",
