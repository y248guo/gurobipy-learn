# Car Rental 1 and 2

## Car Rental 1

This model is an example of a Car Rental problem. A car rental company wants to determine how many cars to own and where 
should they be located at the start of each day of a week to maximize weekly profits. This problem is formulated as a 
linear programming problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 25 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 284-286 and 340-342.

This example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you 
have some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.

## Car Rental 2

This model is an extension of the Car Rental problem. In this problem, the car rental company wants to determine 
in which locations it should expand  repair capacity. This problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear 
programming problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 26 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams 
on pages 287 and 342-343.

This example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that 
you have some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.
