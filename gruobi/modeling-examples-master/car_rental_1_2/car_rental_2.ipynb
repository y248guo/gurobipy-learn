    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A small car rental company\n",
    "(which rents only one type of car) \n",
    "has depots in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Plymouth. There is an estimated demand for each day of the week except Sunday (when the company is closed). These estimates are given in the following table. It is not necessary to meet all demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "![weeklyDemand](weeklyDemand.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cars can be rented for one, two or three days and returned to either the\n",
    "depot from which they were rented or another depot at the start of the next morning. For\n",
    "example, a 2-day rental on Thursday means that the car has to be returned on\n",
    "Saturday morning; a 3-day rental on Friday means that the car has to be returned\n",
    "on Tuesday morning. A 1-day rental on Saturday means that the car has to be\n",
    "returned on Monday morning, and a 2-day rental on Tuesday morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rental period is independent of the origin and destination. From historical\n",
    "data, the company knows the distribution of rental periods: 55% of cars are rented\n",
    "for one day, 20% for two days and 25% for three days. The current estimates\n",
    "of percentages of cars rented from each depot and returned to a given depot\n",
    "(independent of the day) are given in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![FromToPct](FromToPct.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The company's marginal cost\n",
    "of renting out a car (‘wear and tear’, administration, etc.) is estimated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Days rented | Marginal cost |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1-day | $\\$ 20$ |\n",
    "| 2-day | $\\$ 25$ |\n",
    "| 3-day | $\\$ 30$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘opportunity cost’ (interest on capital, storage, servicing, etc.) of owning\n",
    "a car is $\\$ 15$ per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to transfer undamaged cars from one depot to another depot,\n",
    "irrespective of distance. Cars cannot be rented out during the day in which they\n",
    "are transferred. The costs in USD, per car, of transfer are given in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![FromToCst](FromToCst.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten percent of cars returned by customers are damaged. When this happens,\n",
    "the customer is charged an excess of $\\$ 100$  (irrespective of the amount of damage\n",
    "that the company completely covers by its insurance). In addition, the car has\n",
    "to be transferred to a repair depot, where it will be repaired the following day.\n",
    "The cost of transferring a damaged car is the same as transferring an undamaged\n",
    "one (except when the repair depot is the current depot, \n",
    "in which case the cost would be $\\$0$). \n",
    "The transfer of a damaged car takes a day, unless it is already at a repair depot.\n",
    "Having arrived at a repair depot, all types of repair (or replacement) take a day.\n",
    "Only two of the depots have repair capacity. The (cars/day) capacity at each repair depot is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Repair depot | Capacity |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Manchester | 12 |\n",
    "| Birmingham | 20 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Having been repaired, the car is available for rent at the depot the next day\n",
    "or may be transferred to another depot (taking a day). Thus, a car that is returned\n",
    "damaged on a Wednesday morning is transferred to a repair depot (if not the\n",
    "current depot) on Wednesday, repaired on Thursday and is available for rent\n",
    "at the repair depot on Friday morning.\n",
    "The rental price depends on the number of days for which the car is rented\n",
    "and whether it is returned to the same depot or not. The prices (in USD) are given in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![RentalPrice](RentalPrice.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the following at the beginning of each day:\n",
    "1. Customers return cars that are due that day.\n",
    "2. Damaged cars are sent to the repair depot.\n",
    "3. Cars that were transferred from other depots arrive.\n",
    "4. Transfers are sent out.\n",
    "5. Cars are rented out.\n",
    "6. If it is a repair depot, then the repaired cars are available for rental.\n",
    "\n",
    "The car rental company wants to determine in which locations it should expand  repair capacity. The weekly fixed costs, given below, include interest payments on the necessary\n",
    "loans for expansion. The options are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand repair capacity at Birmingham by 5 cars per day at a fixed cost\n",
    "per week of $\\$18,000$.\n",
    "2. Further expand repair capacity at Birmingham by 5 cars per day at a fixed\n",
    "cost per week of $\\$8,000$.\n",
    "3. Expand repair capacity at Manchester by 5 cars per day at a fixed cost per\n",
    "week of $\\$20,000$.\n",
    "4. Further expand repair capacity at Manchester by 5 cars per day at a fixed\n",
    "cost per week of $\\$5,000$.\n",
    "5. Create repair capacity at Plymouth of 5 cars per day at a fixed cost per\n",
    "week of $\\$19,000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these options is chosen, it must be carried out in its entirety; that\n",
    "is, there can be no partial expansion. Also, a further expansion at a depot can be\n",
    "carried out only if the first expansion is also carried out -so, for example, option\n",
    "(2) at Birmingham cannot be chosen unless option (1) is also chosen. If option (2)\n",
    "is chosen, thereby also choosing option (1), these count as two options. Similar\n",
    "stipulations apply regarding the expansions at Manchester. At most three of the\n",
    "options can be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine in which locations to expand  repair capacity, the numbers of cars the car rental company should own, and where they should  be located at the start of each week day in order to maximize weekly profit. The company wants a ‘steady state’ solution in which the same expected number of cars will be located at the same depot on the same day of subsequent weeks."
