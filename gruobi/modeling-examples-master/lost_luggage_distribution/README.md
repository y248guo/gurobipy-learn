# Lost Luggage Distribution

This model is an example of a vehicle routing problem. A small company with six vans has a contract with a number of 
airlines to pick up lost or delayed baggage and deliver each piece of luggage to its owner. This problem is 
formulated as a binary optimization problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 27 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams 
on pages 287-289 and 343-344.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and 
that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function 
and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
