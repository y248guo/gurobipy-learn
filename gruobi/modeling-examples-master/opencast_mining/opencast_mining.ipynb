    "\n",
    "A company has obtained permission to conduct opencast mining within a square plot 200 ft $\\times$ 200 ft. The angle of slip of the soil is such that it is not possible for the sides of the excavation to be steeper than 45 degrees. The company has obtained estimates for the value of the ore in various places at various depths. Bearing in mind the restrictions imposed by the angle of slip, the company decides to consider the problem as one of the extracting of rectangular blocks. Each block has horizontal dimensions 50 ft $\\times$ 50 ft and a vertical dimension of 25 ft. If the blocks are chosen to lie above one another then it is only possible to excavate blocks forming an upturned pyramid. \n",
    "The three dimensional representation below shows four levels of excavation. We have numbered, in black, each block at each level, and the number in red represents the block underneath the four blocks of the level. For example, block 17 of level 2 lies underneath the blocks 1,2,5,and 6 of level 1.\n",
