    "In order to run this Jupyter Notebook properly, you must have a Gurobi license.

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the great advancements that we've seen in mathematical optimization solver technology, some problems are still challenging to solve due to their large number of variables or constraints. Decomposition techniques — such as delayed column generation or Benders decomposition — apply the principle of \"divide and conquer\" to tackle these challenging problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delayed column generation is typically used with large problems, which have so many variables that it's not possible to consider all of them explicitly. Experience with large problems indicates that, usually, most of these variables never enter the basis. Therefore, only a subset of these variables need to ever be considered when solving the problem. Delayed column generation exploits this fact to only generate variables (i.e. columns) that have the potential to improve the objective function. It's interesting to note that generating a column in the primal formulation amounts to adding a constraint to its dual. Thus, you can think of this technique as a cutting plane method in the dual space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delayed column generation has been successfully applied to many problems such as crew scheduling, vehicle routing, the capacitated p-median problem, and the Cutting Stock Problem. We will use the latter to illustrate how this technique can be implemented in the Gurobi-Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cutting Stock Problem deals with the problem of cutting stock material with the same, fixed width — such as paper rolls — into smaller pieces, according to a set of orders specifying both the widths and the demand requirements, so as to minimize the amount of wasted material.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical programming is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates a mathematical optimization model that captures the key aspects of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi Optimizer solves such models using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical optimization model has five components, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets and indices.\n",
    "- Parameters.\n",
    "- Decision variables.\n",
    "- Objective function(s).\n",
    "- Constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we present a naïve IP that doesn't scale well because its linear relaxation is not tight. Then, we introduce a Full Master Problem that explicitly enumerates all possible cut patterns, which turns out to be amenable to delayed column generation.\n",

    "Recall that the number of patterns grows exponentially with the number of final pieces, so in practice the Full Master Problem cannot be solved in one shot. Instead, we consider a Restricted Master Problem (RMP), initialized with a few trivial patterns. Then we follow an iterative approach, alternating between solving a knapsack problem (i.e. the subproblem) to generate a new pattern (i.e. the entering column) and solving a larger RMP to update the objective function — representing the reduced cost of the next pattern to be selected — of the subproblem. This cycle is repeated until the reduced cost of the entering column is non-negative.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showed how to implement delayed column generation using Gurobi in an object-oriented framework. It also suggested a heuristic that can be used in lieu of a branch-and-price scheme, in the event that this is not compatible with Gurobi. Finally, it's worth mentioning that the reader can improve the performance of this implementation by replacing the subproblem routine, which uses a MIP solver, with an algorithm specifically tailored for the Knapsack problem.\n",
