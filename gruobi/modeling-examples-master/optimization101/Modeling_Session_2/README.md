# Modeling Session 2 - Renewable Energy and Storage Optimization

## Problem
A univeristy building is going to hold classes for a week, which requires electricity to run. and the demand for electricity changes due to the course load. There is a solar panel to provide energy and two batteries that can store it. Additionally, electricity can be purchased from the gird. The goal of the problem is to find the battery charge and discharge schedule that will:
1. Minimize the total electrity purchased from the grid.
2. Given electrity prices for each period, minimize the total cost of purchasing electricity from the grid.

Click to access the [Google Colab modeling2 notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/optimization101/Modeling_Session_2/modeling2_colab.ipynb). You will need to be signed into a Google account to execute the notebook. 
 
If you are able to run Jupyter notebooks on your machine, feel free to download the notebook file with the name that *does not* end in *colab*. Also, the  Python packages we use for today other than `gurobipy` are `pandas` and `matplotlib`, so you may need to install those. 

## Beware Spoilers!
We also put **completed** versions of the modeling1 notebook in the repo. If you want to work through the notebook without everything filled in make sure not to open that version.
